\begin{abstract}
In defensive security, Honeypots play an important role to detect attacks by simulating the services of the target system. Over the years, many honeypots have been proposed, developed and deployed over the internet simulating essential protocols and services like HTTP, SSH, Telnet, SMB, SMTP, FTP and also industrial protocols like MODBUS and BARCnet. Survey statistics provided by F-Secure (rfr: F-secure white paper), show that the attack landscape caught by honeypots hosted by F-Secure, have tripled from 2018 with major targeted protocols being Telnet, SMB, SSH and  MSSQL. The rise in attacks can be in view of increase in smart IoT devices and also the accessibility of Cloud infrastructure. Further, resource constraints on IoT devices lead to poor security diligence to achieve performance and availability. Honeypots have been a reliable choice for proactive defense by  network administrators to detect and analyze attacks. Open-source low-interaction honeypots like Kippo, Cowrie, Glastopf, Dionaea and Conpot are the most widely deployed Honeypots (rfr: bitter harvest). As effective as  honeypots can be leveraged to detect attacks, they are also vulnerable to be exposed as decoys thereby reducing their productivity. The identity of honeypots and its ability to remain undetected is a valuable parameter towards its purpose. Studies have shown that these honeypots are easily detectable by various mechanisms. Probing, response analysis and  location/domain filtering are some methods through which the identity of honeypots can be revealed. In addition, machine learning based methods have inferred to increase the predictability and reduce false positives in detection. This paper provides an overview and a new basis for classification of different low interaction honeypot detection mechanisms.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

The rise of Internet of Things and affordable cloud infrastructure has led to a connected world of devices and services working together to achieve better accessibility and connectivity in real time. While these devices are resource constrained, there is more focus on performance and availability rather on security. Also, accessibility being important, leads to various services open to the internet thereby creating a huge risk in security of the system. Leveraging these known vulnerabilities, proactive security strategies like Honeypots are developed and deployed with these flaws to attract exploits from attackers thereby making them vulnerable by design.Honeypots are classified into three types based on their interaction, service simulation and response details into low, medium and high interaction honeypots. As the name suggests, low interaction honeypots are focused on emulating the basic protocol services and do not focus on high interaction. Low interaction honeypots are quick to setup, highly usable and provide basic logging and analysis features. These honeypots are developed  to be deployed in resource constraint environments.    

In addition to various security measures adopted by the administrators, Honeypots form a good defensive tool as decoys, to identify vulnerabilities and detect attacks. They act as a proactive approach to identify malicious sources for attacks and also give an understanding of the vulnerable areas of the system. All communication to the honeypot is considered hostile, since legitimate users have no need to access a honeypot. The use of honeypots as a detection tools date back to over a decade with projects being open and deployed since 2000. Protocols like Telnet and SSH have been widely used even today to establish communication with remote systems. Similarly protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, SNMP, SMB have been the used as base communication protocols for essential services. There are honeypots developed to emulate all the essential protocols. Administrators have been using honeypots to detect the attacks on these protocols over years. However, it has been evident that these honeypots could be detected and identified. This leads to an argument about the use of outdated honeypots and their contribution towards attack detection once they are identified.

Internet wide scanning has now been convenient and popular because of scanning platforms like Shodan and Censys. These platforms provide search based on region, ports, IP addresses and domains to check the services vulnerable and  open to the internet. Tools like NMap provide good scanning abilities to scan the devices. Considering internet wide scanning as a first step and using the results, it is possible to apply various approached to determine if the system is a honeypot. We classify these approaches into Active and Passive approaches.
