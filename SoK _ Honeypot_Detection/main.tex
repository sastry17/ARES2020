\begin{abstract}
In defensive security, Honeypots play an important role to detect attacks by simulating the services of the target system. Over the years, many honeypots have been proposed, developed and deployed over the Internet simulating essential protocols and services like HTTP, SSH, Telnet, SMB, SMTP, FTP and also industrial protocols like MODBUS and BARCnet. Survey statistics provided by F-Secure \cite{F-Secure}, show that the attack landscape caught by honeypots hosted by F-Secure have tripled from 2018 with major targeted protocols being Telnet, SMB, SSH, and  MSSQL. The rise in attacks can be because of an increase in smart IoT devices and also the accessibility of Cloud infrastructure. Further, resource constraints on IoT devices lead to poor security diligence to achieve performance and availability. Honeypots have been a reliable choice for proactive defense by network administrators to detect and analyze attacks. Open-source low-interaction honeypots like Kippo, Cowrie, Glastopf, Dionaea, and Conpot are the most widely deployed Honeypots \cite{Vetterl2018}. As effective as honeypots can be leveraged to detect attacks, they are also vulnerable to be exposed as decoys thereby reducing their productivity. The identity of honeypots and its ability to remain undetected is a valuable parameter towards its purpose. Studies have shown that these honeypots are easily detectable and can be fingerprint by various mechanisms. Probing, response analysis, and location/domain filtering are some methods through which the identity of honeypots can be revealed. Besides, machine learning-based methods have inferred to increase predictability and reduce false positives in detection. This paper provides an overview and a new basis for the classification of honeypot fingerprinting mechanisms.
