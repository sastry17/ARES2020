Honeypots have been an important strategy in proactive defense systems. They are effective security systems capable of detecting new threat vectors. Honeypots are victims of malware botnets and fingerprinting networks that intend to expose their identities.  We survey and summarize honeypot fingerprinting methods and propose a taxonomy. We evaluate the classified fingerprinting methods against popular honeypots and determine their resilience. As future work, we aim to continue finding new honeypot fingerprinting methods. We further use the new findings and this taxonomy to propose new design considerations for the development of resilient honeypots.
