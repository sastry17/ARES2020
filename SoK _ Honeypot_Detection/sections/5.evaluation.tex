We evaluate popular open source honeypots with the proposed classification. We try to fingerprint the honeypots by harnessing the methods. The honeypots under evaluation are from the Honeynet project. The evaluation involves setting up of all the honeypots on a public internet facing system. Each honeypot is targeted with both low and high effort techniques. 
 
\subsection{Low-effort Honeypot Fingerprinting Techniques}
 We subject the honeypots to low-effort fingerprinting method. The data retrieved is then used to infer the existence of a honeypot. We propose three approaches for the evaluation of low-effort fingerprinting techniques. The first approach involves searching Shodan and Censys for the IP address of the target system. The second approach involves searching for vulnerable services exposed to the internet through Shodan and determining if the target system is a honeypot. The last approach involves using keyword search in the search engines(Shodan and Censys). We use the metadata obtained from the search results to fingerprint the honeypots. 
 
 \subsubsection{IP address Search}
The IP address of the suspected target system is used as a search parameter to determine the open ports, services, geo-location, hostname and the hosting provider. By correlating the data obtained from the search results it is possible to infer the presence of a honeypot. For example, if the IP address does not resolve to a domain name, has the port 500 open and is hosted on a cloud, it is very likely that the system is a honeypot. This is because port 500 is used for the MODBUS protocol for network communication in Industrial Control Systems. It is very unlikely to have ICS systems hosted on the cloud as they are physical systems that are deployed in industrial environments.
